    <img src="images/HH/bike.jpg" class="right img-responsive">
    <p>The new Bullet 500 is essentially the motorcycle with the timeless iconic handcrafted design of the legendary Bullet now powered with a solid 500 cc Unit Construction Engine with Twinspark ignition for better combustion, superior power delivery and improved fuel economy. Now technologically equipped with modern advances in engineering this motorcycle still maintains its impeccable lineage it has withheld for decades altogether. The iconic Bullet is now available in an all new shade of Forest Green with the same aristocratic livery pinstriping now in a silver finish symbolic of automotive royalty</p>
    <p>The smaller twin of the Classic 500, the Classic 350 will hold its own against any other motorcycle and then pull some more. The Classic 350 shares its powerplant with the legendary Thunderbird Twinspark. The torque to flatten mountains and the fuel efficiency to cross entire ranges comes in the same understated yet charming styling.</p>
    <p>This is a motorcycle that does not need to shout to be heard. Born of a rich heritage and bred with Royal Elegance this 350cc thumper has all the qualities of a typical Royal Enfield. Appreciated then, appreciated now... Why ride a lesser bike. Nothing more to be said?</p>
    <p>The Royal Enfield Bullet is one of the oldest machines in the company’s portfolio which is still in production, This is because it gets a lot of admiration from the customers and has shown a good amount of sales over the past few years. Currently, the motorcycle is available in three trims - the Bullet 500, the Bullet Electra and the Bullet 350.</p>
